So, I made a song exclusively for Rhythm Doctor. Let's talk about it.

## Why'd you do it?

I honestly don't know. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing that just formulated
in a quick 1-hour composing session.

There's a bunch of random things that came together, too. I recently downloaded
Analog Lab from Arturia and wanted to take it for a spin. (The free version. Not the one that
costs $500. I'm not made of money.)

It was also a little bit of a fun exercise on making music fit for rhythm games.
I've never done anything like this before, so it's useful for me to figure out where I can
improve for next time.

## Where can I play?

Rhythm Doctor is a game on Steam. You press the space bar on the 7th beat, with a few exceptions:
- Sometimes the beats don't sound if there's X's
- There's these things called one-shots that act weird
- Have you ever heard of hot and cold beats?
- The triangles and the squares exist

It's a very fun rhythm game, and that's why I made it for Rhythm Doctor. You can subscribe on Steam Workshop.

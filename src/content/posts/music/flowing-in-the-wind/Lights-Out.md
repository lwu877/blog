Lights Out was supposed to be an homage to the endless nights I spent looking up at my ceiling, tracing the little curves on the ceiling.

Instead, it ended up sounding like an electro dance track. Which wasn’t exactly what I was going for, but it sounds nice.

This was also one of the first songs I’d ever made. I think this was the 5th song that I made after I learned the ropes on how to use my DAW.

Fun fact: every single song on the EP was originally supposed to have lyrics. Except for this one. Part of the problem with making the notes first before the lyrics is that, sometimes, you can’t jam lyrics into what you have. And that’s when you either scrap the project, or you go all-in on the instrumental. This really isn’t one of my favourite songs for this very specific reason. If I could go back in time, I probably would’ve spent a little more time ironing out all the little things.

This may sound like a stupid move on my part, but just because every other song had lyrics and this one didn’t, I decided to scrap all the lyrics and go fully instrumental. This is probably one of the worst mistakes I have ever made.

I’m not proud of this. I’m not proud of who I was when I wrote it. I’m a dramatically different person now.

In the future, I’ll rerecord [Walking in the Snow](walking-in-the-snow) with the lyrics it always deserved. I already have the score and lyrics ready. The question for me is when I can move on with this.

In essence – screw this song. I made it, and I’m not proud of it.

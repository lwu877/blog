Artists usually have one chance to make sure that their music sounds right to everyone. This includes mastering, making sure that there aren’t any technical glitches in the final product, and making visually appealing album art (fun fact! text on a background does NOT look visually appealing!)

There’s plenty of ways that people can get over their losses in the industry. One way is to entirely forget that it happened. Another way is to play it down as a joke. I personally thought that the melody of the song was good, it was just the technical issues and my budgetary constraints (as well as my lack of experience!) that made me hate this song. As a result of all of this, I determined there was only one solution.

Taking a Trip was initially meant to portray the wonders of a trip to another place. The melody’s bouncy, the drum beat’s snappy, and there’s no doubt that the piano and glockenspiel sound… fresh. The last “chorus” (can’t really call it a chorus because, as you may have noticed, there’s no lyrics!) was somewhat of a last-minute decision. It was meant to portray how we often reminisce about the trips we take after we take them. When leaving New York City, for example, I often feel like I’ve missed a chance to fully engage with everyone I’m visiting. And that’s what that last part means to me.

This song released on August 18th, 2023, as the third track to my debut EP “Flowing in the Wind.”

Home was one of the very first songs I ever made.

The bubbliness of the random electric piano, the sharpness of the glockenspiel (one of the few instruments I know how to play – I grew up on piano, then learned how to play the glockenspiel in 4th grade), and the small undertones of the erhu, another instrument that I somewhat know how to play, were all parts of what made this song a song I was proud of at the time.

Now? I’m making way better music. Music with lyrics. Music with soul. And music with more interesting stories.

This song was originally supposed to be an homage to my musical influences, but I quickly scrapped that idea after realising that I didn’t know who I was being influenced by. Was it the pop artists that I’d been listening to recently? Was it the classical music that I was basically forced to listen to for hours upon hours? Or was it the ethnic music that I listened to while being young in New York? I’m really not sure.

Looking back at the original revisions I made to the song, I never really changed much about it. I swapped the real snaps I had done in front of a microphone for some ones I got the license to use. And I think it sounds about the same. Except for the fact that I didn’t know how to snap very well, so that may have been the reason behind that swap.

Also, all of the songs originally had some reverb attached to it. I’m not sure why I thought this was a good idea stylistically, but I removed it from the final version because it felt cheap.

Overall, this was a very forgettable song in retrospect. I probably should’ve put [Walking in the Snow](Walking-in-the-Snow) up at the top.

Memories is the second piece I ever composed and the first song I ever wrote lyrics for. That being said, it isn’t my best work. (So far, I think “[Walking in the Snow](walking-in-the-snow)” takes the crown.)

## Memories Lyrics

> I’ve done all the things I could’ve done\
> and lost the things I didn’t do\
> and now I’m sitting at this place beside you\
> I’ve always thought that after time\
> And after I’ve made up my mind\
> The stills will stay from the years of far away

> Some things will always change\
> Some things won’t stay the same\
> but those things inside your brain\
> Those are your memories\
> Even when it’s all done\
> You’ll try and remember everyone\
> But after time has passed today\
> I know that memories go away

> And after I walk off this stage\
> There’s nothing else from yesterday\
> Saying goodbye, waving, driving off today\
> The things that I used to like\
> The people that I knew with time\
> But now they’re just a piece of my mind

> Some things will never change\
> Some things won’t stay the same\
> but those things inside your brain\
> Those are your memories\
> Even when it’s all done\
> You’ll try and remember everyone\
> But after time has passed today\
> I know that memories go away

> Where’s all the people I knew?\
> Where’s all the things I used to know?\
> I don’t know what’s in the dark unknowns\
> Some day I’ll look back\
> See the people\
> All the people I used to know\
> But now they’re just whispers of my mind

> Some things will never change\
> Some things won’t stay the same\
> but those things inside your brain\
> Those are your memories\
> Even when it’s all done\
> You’ll try and remember everyone\
> But sometimes that doesn’t work

> Some things will never change\
> Some things won’t stay the same\
> but those things inside your brain\
> Those are your memories\
> Going outside, taking pics\
> All the music, all the licks\
> There’s all the errands out all day\
> But sometimes things will go away

> People drift far away\
> And things can’t always stay\
> There’s adventures out there to be made\
> And somewhere I will drift into the grey that I used to know\
> And all the colours came back home\
> There’s memories I’ve yet to make\
> But sometimes things will go away

## Creation

I wrote this all the way back in 2021. This was the second song I ever wrote, so I didn’t really know what I was doing. I just threw together something based on my very first song, “[Running](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/868282).” (I plan on reimagining that song in the near future – it’s a question of what I can bring to the table again to make it sound good.)

The lyrics didn’t come until 2023. I knew what I wanted the song to be about, but I didn’t know what should go in the song. It took me a while, but after being around people I knew I would have to leave when I graduate, I finally got a spark for a song.

Yes, this was a song intended for my graduating year. It’s debuting early because I want a specific friend of mine to have one thing to remember me by before they go off into the real world.

## Story

This song tells the story of someone who’s ready to walk off the stage of a graduation. It tells the story of someone who still wants to go back to what they used to know. And it tells of what will happen in the future. In the moment, you’ll probably be in a standstill. But life will carry on. And that’s just the way things go. (At least, probably. I haven’t graduated yet. I can make guesses though.)

The small mention of colours is just a little reference to my life. I’d say that I hit a little bit of a creative block during 2022 and early 2023. All the colours came back home (at least, I think. Green seems to be my new normal colour. Which I’m fine with. Green goes with a lot of things.)

## Final Notes

It’s just a silly little song by a silly little composer from years of yesterday. There’s nothing more to it. My writing skills aren’t that good.

I’m recording this song and releasing this on May 18th, 2024 to all your favourite streaming platforms.

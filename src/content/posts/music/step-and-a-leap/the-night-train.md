The Night Train is a song against time, future education, and leaving it all behind.

## Creation
I started writing this song as a choral song to publish online and sell last April, but I couldn't quite nail down the lyrics. I pushed it off as a summer project, along with most of my other projects.

After having a falling-out with some of my friends in the summer, I was left with a lot of time to think. Lots of people that I knew - yet none that seemed that close to me.

Then, I remembered this one person (that I will not dox publicly on the internet - if you know me, you'll probably know who it is) that I knew from tech week for our production of Romeo and Juliet, and from a class we had together. I decided to pop into their DMs and say hi.

(Well, it wasn't actually me popping into their DMs. It was more so his sister complaining that we both went to see a Madilyn Mei concert without her. We subsequently bonded over music tastes, general mischief, and a friend/sibling in common.)

Point is, we started to become friends back in the summer, before I had really thought about college. I'd been putting it off in lieu of [the musical I was writing for school](http://blog.lexwu.com/posts/life/march-2025/#the-murder-at-evansmith-manor-temporary-title), but it soon finally hit me that we were probably both going to different places.

I'm connected with a lot of people, but only really close friends with four or five, and after what happened last summer, I didn't want to burn any more bridges. So I wrote a song - a song about the travels we'd face, the nights I've thought about this, and about how we can't guarantee that we'll cross paths later, but how our paths will be similar somehow.

## Story
Two friends are off to college on the same train, headed from Boston to New York. I'm headed to Stony Brook (my target school), whlie my friend is headed over to the University of Washington out west. We're both passing villages and little towns in the dark (wait! is that how ✨the night train✨ was named? ooo).

They seemed like the type of person to press themselves against the window looking out into the vast forests outside (after all, they do love cavetown). We're both chugging along to our own different paths - but our similarities will bring us somewhere that we won't know until way later down the line.

That's essentially all the backstory you need to know about the song.

Oh, and that they're a wonderful artist. And that I'm a singer who writes their own music.

## Sheet Music?

I did mention that this used to be a choral arrangement. I still have the parts for a choral arrangement, and I'm currently in the process of re-scoring it to work with these new lyrics. I expect to release the full sheet music in June (lots of projects. Sorry!)

## Closing Notes
Don't burn bridges that you don't want to burn. I didn't know my boundaries, and I didn't have standards before, but I've set them both now.

Also, this little song is dedicated to that little (both physically and metaphorically) friend I've been mentioning this whole time. Still no name? Yep.

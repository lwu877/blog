Running was a piece I made back in 2019. It wasn’t good by any means, but that’s not the point.

Originally produced by myself going completely off improv (no metronome, no sheet music, no nothing), the song wasn’t very good. And it wasn’t meant to be good. I just wanted to make an original song for Geometry Dash. (This seems like a very mediocre reason to make a song. And you’re right. It was.)

Fast forward five years and I now have the technical know-how to make a proper song. I thought I’d reimagine it for old time’s sake.

## So, where’s the inspiration?

I honestly don’t remember where or when I thought this was a good idea. Maybe I heard the chord progression from Super Smash Bros for Wii U / 3DS. I genuinely can’t remember.

## What did you use?

Instead of going to my normal repertoire of instruments, I decided to look for some different virtual synthesizers and mix it up with some stuff I hadn’t touched in a while.

Arturia has a great selection of synthesizers available for free. I mixed that with the normal virtual drum kit I usually use and put some of it into a bitcrusher for the first time.

I also thought it’d be funny to sneak in an otamatone. 12-year-old me would be proud of where I am today.

## So, where’s the download?

There was a part of me that always wanted to let the world use my music for whatever they wanted. Granted, my music wasn’t good enough to use, so…

I’m releasing this music on Newgrounds and Pixabay. Download it. Make something with it. Do whatever you want with it. Remix it. Make it into something better I couldn’t ever dream of.

Let's start with the big stuff first, and then I'll move on to future projects.

## [Music](https://lwumusic.com)

I finally have a brand spankin-new website to showcase my music! It's just a simple landing page in case someone's specificallyl interested in my music work, but it does the job. 

I developed it based off a [Stone Astro Template](https://github.com/m6v3l9/astro-theme-stone), but reworked most of it to fit my needs. This included creating a directory for lyrics, chords, and such. 

## General Cleanup
I've updated every single website to Astro 5.0 and such. I'm still working on fixing the backends of a few websites, and I still need to work on a few other miscellaneous websites, but it'll all be worth it later down the line.

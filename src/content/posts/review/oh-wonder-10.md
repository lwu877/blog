I want to try and get all my stuff together, so here goes.

## Body Gold

Let’s break it down step by step.

### Intro/First Verse

I personally like the callback to the bridge — it’s something different from how many songs preview their chorus. The acoustic piano sound also helps contrast it from the electric piano sound that’s prominent throughout the rest of the song.

It seems like their equipment has changed a lot (which would make sense - technology has changed a lot in the last 10 years!) because I can hear a lot more bass in their voices. The original had almost the same sensation as a radio.

### Chorus

This part was mixed way differently from the original. Instead of bringing out the mids of the voice, it seems like the low-end from the piano was allowed to stay. That’s why their voices sound completely full.

It sounds quite different from the original. That’s all I can say.

The drum kit was also altered, adding more percussive notes throughout the chorus. I don’t think anyone would’ve noticed, but it’s nice to hear.

### Second Verse

The acoustic piano’s brought back for this verse, and it’s a background piece. Something that doesn’t detract from the original.

The original has a somewhat grating bass sound, so it’s nice to hear that it was disguised a little better in the newer version.

### Final Chorus

A lot of what defined earlier works of Oh Wonder was the lack of harmony between Josephine and Anthony. They mostly sang in octaves, which sounded great, but having them sing in chords for this final chorus truly cements how much they've both grown as artists.

It's a genuine joy to hear, and I do hope that they'll visit the states again.

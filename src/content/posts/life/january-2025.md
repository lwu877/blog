New look, huh? Everything's different, everything's new, and everything's soooooooo much faster now. Let's talk about it.

Oh, and if you're wondering where the other posts have gone? You're not crazy - I deleted them all. New year, probably best to start fresh.

## New Look, Same Crazy Person
I've redone my entire portfolio website, created a new bio page, and am in the process of redoing my music website. [Astro](https://astro.build) has been incredible and it's made this entire thing so much easier - and so much cheaper. Instead of paying for hosting, I'm simply paying for this domain, which means I can worry less about money and more about doing the stuff I love (like music, photography, coidng - ok, this may be a problem)

## [oh my god, a new podcast](https://blog.lexwu.com/posts/podcasts/ham-radio-1)
I've been aiming to get back to doing a podcast - one shorter, so much easier, and something that I can also listen to on the weekends. I teamed up with Vian Vera and created [Here's a Minute](https://curtainlorimer.com/projects/heres-a-minute/), a podcast with creative writing prompts and fun facts in a minute or two. It's been going great - except for the fact that we haven't been able to come up with some family-friendly fun facts about Edgar Allen Poe. The guy's a monster.

## more music?
I have yet to reveal the specifics, but ever since I finished a school project involving music, singing, and a really cruddy storyline, I've been wanting to put it out to the world. It's not quite ready yet, but here's a sneak peek at what I've been working on.

## robots.
The robotics team at our school is finally kicking into gear - and I'm the one leading our business team into a dark cave without a clue where I'm going. I'm also very tired of trying to teach about how to use WordPress - it's very slow and I'm so much more used to typing into VSCode to write blog posts now.

Considering that we're about to enter the season, maybe an entire rewrite of the website isn't a great idea - but screw it. I'm planning on rewriting our entire website in Astro just because the speeds and downtime we're getting is unacceptable.

Also, I really don't like the beef between WPEngine and WordPress.com. Thank god I migrated earlier this year.

## curtain lorimer returns
So I've been meaning to do a bunch of projects for a while now. I'm almost at the end of the tunnel, but there's still so many more projects I want to get done. And there's so many more projects that I want to do with other people before I say goodbye.

Enter the return of [Curtain Lorimer.](https://curtainlorimer.com) It's an incubator for ideas made by me, and hopefully friends of mine. We're all very creative, talented, and cunning, and we're all able to help out each other with our little side projects. A touch of tech support here, a dash of writing and acting here, etc.

I'm aiming for this to become sort of a collective. Only time will tell what happens, but I've started the ball.

## the thing about those websites

You may be noticing that everything looks different around here. I've been hard at work redoing every single one of my websites from the ground up with Astro in an effort to cut costs and make my online life generally easier to manage.

I'll go through each of these in a little bit of detail.

### [Portfolio](https://lexwu.com)
College applications are coming up soon, and I knew that some colleges would use your personal website as a portfolio for your work. That's why I went to work on trying to make it the best it could be. Of course, it was the second time I'd ever used Astro (the first was an experimental side project that's still in deployment), so the results weren't that great.

::github{repo="withastro/astro"}

I used Astro's official portfolio template and tailored it to my needs. Unfortunately, trying to get blog posts and projects to work was hell. So I eventually settled on creating a new website for my blog - it's easier for me to separate stuff this way, and that's what I want. A few levels of separation.

### [Blog](/)
Eventually, I'd need to get the blog done. Luckily, I'd had experience in this - but unfortunately, I accidentally broke my entire previous blog. I didn't even know what happened - just an upgrade and poof! (In retrospect, it was probably TinaCMS and its multitude of security vulnerabilities, but I didn't know that at the time.)

Anyways, posts were already written, so I copied and pasted them in. Then, I realized how much more I could do with a website like this, so I deleted them and started fresh. You're looking at a brand-spanking new website. And it's beautifully built.
::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}
I'll get licensing out of the way later - right now, I just need to get everything online first.

### [Music Blog](https://blog.lwumusic.com)
So it turns out that I have a lot more music than I thought. And I thought it would be great to keep a little website full of my entire discography, plus a little bit of extras from development for those who really want to read into it.
::github{repo="saicaca/fuwari"}

It's also built with Fuwari, and I love it.

### But what about the regular music website?
I've put that off for now and just sent it to my blog for now. I really want to make something with the energy of [Madilyn Mei's website](https://madilynmei.com) with some of the design cues from [Taylor Swift's website](https://tserasarchive.taylorswift.com/midnights). This'll be a challenge - but I'm always up for one.

## Closing Notes

It's been so long since I've written a proper blog post. And I hope it won't be the last time I forget about this. School has been so busy, my life is constantly tied up in musical ventures (jazz, percussion, choir, band), and yet I still have the energy to keep moving.

We've all got a few stories we want to tell. Share them out. After all, there's no such thing as a bad story - just a lesson to learn.

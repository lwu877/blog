Hey! It's June, I'm finally out of school for the summer, and who knows what's next.

## a little more change to scheduling

I'm about to shoot my previous schedule in the foot.

- **[Hereâ€™s a Minute](https://www.heresaminute.com)** - now on hiatus
- **[Hereâ€™s an Answer](https://www.heresaminute.com)** - also now on hiatus

And for the rest of my projects:

- **The Night Train** - now releasing later in July, alongside a new EP
- **The Murder at Gilmore Manor** - currently rewriting all the music for (you'll see why)

You can read my full answer as to why we're taking Here's a Minute into a hiatus [on our website.](https://heresaminute.com/posts/blog/june-2025/)

## life stuff

For those who don't know me, I'm chronically the worst person when it comes to watching movies and TV shows sometime around their release date, which
is why I've finally seen La La Land, Cats, and Gnomeo and Juliet in the past few weeks. And I think one of these has reshaped my entire philosophy around life.

### Cats

I genuinely think this is the most boring movie I've ever watched. It's not bad in the Cat in the Hat way, or sad like the Human Centipede (still haven't watched, don't know if it's sad or sadistic - probably both)
but it's also just... really boring. Like, there's barely any plot to it all, and I could only name one catchy song from the entire thing.

I'm also just realizing I forgot to publish this. So there's also that.

I'll come up with a much longer one soon... I hope.

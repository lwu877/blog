After a full month of website development and other side projects, I'm finally back to working on some of my primary projects. And I'm still saddling myself with more side quests. Here we go!

## robots
It's a miracle that I haven't overworked myself with the amount of stuff that we've been cramming into the last minute. There's still an award video I have yet to edit, there's spirit stuff that I'm technically responsible for, and I'm still flailing around like I have no idea what I'm doing.

## new side project
A puzzle game is now in development by yours truly. Yes, I'm aware this adds to the pile of stuff that I've committed myself to, but it'll be fine.

The premise is that you're a detective in London, trying to solve a small-town mystery. I've incorporated a few bits of Layton-esque music, but it's still very much in development and I don't see this project being done until sometime in 2027. I'm also not sharing the gimmick because I feel like it's really creative and I don't want anyone else beating me to the punch.

## Closing Notes

Definitely a shorter blog post than usual. I'm not usually a writer that does stuff like this.

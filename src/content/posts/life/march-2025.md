I've been off from school from the past week, so I've accelerated so many of my projects and been involved in so much more stuff.

## music

Music projects take a lot of time to develop and fully solidify before release. That's been the case for four of my side projects - they've been in development since last year, and they're somehow coincidencially all ready to show off now.

### the night train
A song I've been working on since last April. I planned on performing it during a little school concert, but it's only now completely solidified, with some lyrics that resonate with (most likely) more than one person.

I'm planning to release it as a single sometime in April. The plan for an EP is to release this, Memories, and two or three other songs in time for graduation in June.

My singing voice is not the best (I'm much more of a composer, at the end of the day) but I'm sure someone out there will like it.

### here's a minute - the first soundtrack

I always expected to release the soundtrack of this podcast - it's just what songs I wanted to include. My entire back catalog of songs goes into the hundreds, and there's so many different songs that could've made the soundtrack and been the backing track to your favourite short-form podcast on Sundays.

Pending approval from my distributor, it releases March 9th to all streaming platforms at the same time as that week's episode (that we haven't written.)

## snapshot (film)
A short film about loss, grief, and graduation. It's not quite the typical film most people make on their first go-around (my friend's working on a feature-length film right now), and the concepts I'm applying don't really appear in most films, but I'm sure that there'll be someone to watch it.

I'm sure you might be able to guess the gimmick of this film based on the name, and I'm fairly certain I'll change it halfway through filming (I'm already thinking of alternative names!) but this is what's stuck so far.

I'm currently developing this in the background of my other work, but it will come out eventually. I'm planning on this showing up sometime later in Q4 of 2025. In the meantime, here's a draft of something I've composed for the soundtrack.

## podcasts

### here's a minute

Over the last two weeks, we've talked about DNA and Pluto, and the online portal launched a little earlier last week. You can visit it at [heresaminute.com](https://heresaminute.com), or listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1Xmaek9r2UmdnwTZZRCFVG?si=9b0d7126b75b4aed) (or wherever you get your podcasts).

### here's an answer (temporary title)

Haven't quite cleared this title with Vian, but here goes.

I'm currently developing a podcast where your answers that you submit to our online portal will be read aloud in dramatic style. Instead of being more of a short form podcast (like, less than a minute), it'll probably be more of a comedic or dramatic longer-form podcast.

As previously stated, it's currently in development, but it's nice to finally know what that super secret second project finally is.

### the murder at evansmith manor (temporary title)
> there's a murder in this place and it's somewhere in this space

> *lex wu, as five guests and two hosts*

From the ashes of a really extravogant but fundamentally flawed capstone project comes a brand new awakening! The Murder at Evansmith Manor (temporary title) is a whodunnit podcast in the form of a musical - something that I'm pretty sure hasn't been tried before.

It's still very much a work in progress (I've only adapted about half the script, and I have yet to write five more songs) but I'm planning to launch the three-episode extravoganza somewhere in July.

## robotics
Even though it says that it's published on March 1st, in actuality, I'm writing this on February 27th. Two days before competition, and we've got two people making reddit posts about various issues about our robot. I feel like that summarizes how we're doing pretty well.

There is a possibility that I'll be doing live updates on one of our social media platforms, but you could also check out our [blog](https://wireclippers.org/blog).

## life

Extremely messy at the moment. There's plenty of work to be done at the moment, and I've been making money to fund these side projects exclusively off DoorDash for the past month. I do have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/lwu877) if you'd like to pitch in and alleviate some of this stress off me - any help is appreciated.

## websites
Let's start with the big stuff first, and then I'll move on to future projects.

### [Music](https://lwumusic.com)

I finally have a brand spankin-new website to showcase my music! It's just a simple landing page in case someone's specificallyl interested in my music work, but it does the job.

I developed it based off a [Stone Astro Template](https://github.com/m6v3l9/astro-theme-stone), but reworked most of it to fit my needs. This included creating a directory for lyrics, chords, and such.

### General Cleanup
I've updated every single website to Astro 5.0 and such. I'm still working on fixing the backends of a few websites, and I still need to work on a few other miscellaneous websites, but it'll all be worth it later down the line.

## closing notes

Life could be better. Side projects could definintely be pushed off. However, I've got a busy March ahead of me, and I'm sure that someone out there will appreciate all this work somewhere down the line.

First things first: surprise! I'm a student at Stony Brook University now. I'm studying Journalism and hoping that the climate of the job market works out - but if not, I always have way too many other projects to fall back on.

## The Night Train

I hate to push off stuff because I know I can make cool stuff in time, but here we go again: I'm pushing off the EP indefinitely at this point.

Honestly, I don't think it fits very well with what I know I can write now, which brings me to my next point: I'm making more music here and am planning to release some stuff for the holidays.

I've also been trying a few new styles, although it ultimately [ends up with me covering random songs.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPw3ikfkaWGGF6YIunkl3w_mFjqceWgxKvtzME0/)

## The Vocalists

I'm proud to share that I'm now a member of the Stony Brook Vocalists, one of three acapella groups here at the university. We recently had an acoustic night, so that was fun. (Please don't watch the whole thing!)

## The thing about the websites (again)

Third time's the charm?

You might notice this website looks a little different. That's because I've been doing plenty of back-end work to switch my websites from Cloudflare Pages to Workers, so I thought I'd take the time to revamp this particular blog because I never 100% liked how it looked.

I also now understand the joys of having everything on one website. You don't have to recreate components for multiple sites, upgrade components on every single page you have, and all that. It gets annoying quick.

Hopefully, this is actually the last time I swap out the theme - but I think we all know it most definitely isn't.

### A story about the swap

If I said that I've been learning Javascript, the intricacies of Cloudflare's services, and CSS on the fly, you'd probably believe me.

When I initially attempted to build the website, it kept throwing me Wrangler errors, and it only took me about 30 minutes to figure out I needed to add Wrangler to the dependencies for this website.

I then spent the next 30 minutes after that learning what the hell a Wrangler was, what it required, and why it was causing pain.

Once I got it to build, I attempted to deploy it and then ended up displaying a copy of my website I deleted off the servers a year ago.

This is why I'm not a computer science major `:P`

## le wolfie's big band

Performed at open mic night for them, then also performed at open mic night for the Pipettes. You will not be seeing either one of these performances because they were... not the best.

## some actual music updates

Currently working on an EP, hoping to release it in December, actually creating deadlines, yada yada. We'll see how this pans out.

It'll be about my experiences on Long Island, and how it's different from everything else I've ever experienced. Because someone moving away from home is a lot to deal with.

No song names (one was leaked by myself on accident, whoops) yet.

That's it. That's the post. Hopefully nothing eventful happens on this trip up north.
